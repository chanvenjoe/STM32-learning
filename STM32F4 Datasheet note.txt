Timer 1/8 is advance-control timer

Have all functions that general timer do

Timer 2-5

2 and 5 have 32bits auto reloader

*input capture
*Output compare
*PWM generation
*One-pulse mode output
*support DMA request generation
*Capable of handling quadrature(incremental) encoder signals and digital output from hall sensors

Timer 9-14

10.11.13.14 have 1 channel for those four features(in/out put /PWM/One-pulse mode output)
Timer 9 and 12 have 2.

basic timers 6 and 7

These timers are mainly used for DAC trigger and waveform generation. They can also be 
used as a generic 16-bit time base.
TIM6 and TIM7 support independent DMA request generation

Independent watchdog
*12 bits downcounter and 8bits prescaler
*clocked from 32KHz internal RC(independent from main clock)
can operate in Stop and standby modes.
